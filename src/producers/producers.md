# Producers

These are responsible for generating the input files for simulations.
Disolv needs three main input data:

### Positions
Location data or traces of vehicles and infrastructure is essential to support VANET simulation.

### Activation
The time period for which an agent is active in the simulation must be given as input.
Positions do this calculation because it goes hand-in-hand with the trace data.

### Links
The neighbor information for all agents is required to simulate interactions.

## Pipeline
The first entry point is the positions producer.
Positions will produce the positions and activation data.
Next is the links, which will use the data generated by the positions and creates links data.
The combined output will then form the input to Disolv.
