# Design

Disolv is an agent-based model with Discrete-time based progression.
The primary goal of Disolv is to support large-scale evaluation of VANET studies.
As a result, all the design decisions of Disolv are oriented towards performance improvements when compared to state-of-the-art VANET simulators.
We describe the conceptual design and the software implementation decisions.
A typical workflow is imagined and relevant guidelines are provided to better exploit Disolv capabilities.

More details about the design decisions and the motivation for designing the simulator are accepted for presentation at [SIGSIM - PADS '24](https://dl.acm.org/conference/pads/proceedings).
